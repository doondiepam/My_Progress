Day – 4: More Problems on All Data Types with Auto Coding Practice

Practiced problems using all basic data types: int, float, str, bool, list, tuple, set

Wrote programs to:

Take user input and identify its data type automatically

Convert input values into different types using type casting

Check whether a number is even or odd (int + bool logic)

Solved problems on strings:

Reverse a string

Count vowels and consonants

Check if a string is a palindrome

Solved problems on lists:

Sort a list without using built-in functions

Find the second largest number

Remove duplicates using a set

Solved problems on tuples:

Find the index of an element

Count occurrences of a value

Solved problems on sets:

Find common elements between two sets

Check subset and superset conditions

Practiced auto-code style problems (logic-based coding without hints)

Focused on writing clean, readable Python code for each solution
