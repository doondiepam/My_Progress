Day – 2: Lists, Tuples & Sets

Started learning Python collections: list, tuple, and set

Understood that lists are ordered and mutable

Practiced list operations: append(), remove(), sort(), indexing

Learned that tuples are ordered but immutable

Used tuples to store fixed data

Understood that sets are unordered and store only unique values

Practiced add(), remove() on sets

Learned the key differences between list, tuple, and set

Solved small examples for each data structure
