Day 1



In day – 1 I started learning the basics of Python and focused on understanding data types.
I learned how to create variables and store values like numbers, text, and True/False.
I studied the main types: int, float, string, and boolean and used the type() function to check them.
I also practiced taking input from the user and converting it using type casting.
By the end of the day, I wrote small programs to add numbers and work with strings.
Overall, it was a good start to building my Python foundation.
